# tic_tac_toe

Tic tac toe game with 3 modes.
Player versus Player.
Player versus AI.
AI versus AI.

## Installation


to install it there are two ways:

Preffered Method: Open terminal
    git clone https://github.com/cashe603/TicTacToeRuby
    navigate to the cloned repo
    $cd lib
    $ruby tic_tac_toe.rb

also it might be possible to clone this repository and navigate to the folder and use $gem install tic_tac_toe
However it is not working on my machine as of this moment. So the classic method is preffered.

## How it works

As the tic tac toe player your mission is to win 3 to the 
diagonal/horizonal/vertical

You can choose to play against an AI or a friend, or even watch two AIs battle it out.
